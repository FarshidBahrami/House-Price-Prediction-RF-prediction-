# House-Price-Prediction-RF-prediction-
This Regression Model based on RF algorithm tends to predict the house price. 

The First pipeline called 'Data Cleaning' is designed seperately for data cleaning, outlier detection. 

Another pipline like called 'Preprocessing' handles the standarazation of the numerical features based on the Standard Scaling and apply One-Hot Encoding over the categorical features.

The last Pipeline is designed to train the model based on RF algorithm.
